# Task4-AI-launch-navigation
Using SLAM map to launch the navigation

# - Launch Simulation World:

$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

# - Run Navigation Node:

$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml

# - Estimate Initial Pose
#### 1. click on the 2D Pose Estimate button in the RViz menu.
#### 3. click on the map where the actual robot is located and drag the arrow toward the direction where the robot is facing.
#### 4. Repeat step 1 and 2 until the LDS sensor data is overlayed on the saved map.
#### 5. Launch keyboard teleoperation node to precisely locate the robot on the map:
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

#### 5. Move the robot back and forth a bit to collect the surrounding environment information and narrow down the estimated location of the TurtleBot3 on the map which is displayed with tiny green arrows.
#### 6. Terminate the keyboard teleoperation node by entering Ctrl + C

# - Set Navigation Goal
#### 1. Click the 2D Nav Goal button in the RViz menu.
#### 2. Click on the map to set the destination of the robot and drag the green arrow toward the direction where the robot will be facing.
